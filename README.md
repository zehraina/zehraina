Hi, I'm Ina (iːnə). My interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I do Data Science, Machine Learning, competitive programming and all that good stuff.  I like to code and I code a lot. I've been programming since 2018. I know advanced Python and C/C++. I'm a web content writer at GeeksForGeeks, I write on topics related to AI, blockchain and other tech-topics. What I believe is that 
> one should know everything about something and something about everything. 


I'm a hands-on learner. I'd rather dive into the practical work than read the theories. I learn by doing.

I use Python on a daily basis and I love it. You can have a look at some of the projects I've built! 

Apart from being tech-savvy, I love music. Moslty I listen to rock, punk and heavy metal. I'm a huuuge fan of Queen, Led Zepplin, AC DC, Motorhead, Arctic Monkeys and Ceed. My music taste is very mixed, I also listen to Shawn Mendes, Drake, The Weeknd, John Mayer and many more. I've always wanted to learn to play guitar. I'm also a self-taught-not-so-good guitarist. I'm that cool computer person who's open to everything, loves to share knowledge and can talk about anything! 



## If you want to reach me out, I'm everywhere. You can connect with me on LinkedIn and Instagram. Feel free to hit me up.
